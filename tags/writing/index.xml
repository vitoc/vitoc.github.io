      <description>AD:
So how do we write a blog post together Vito?
VC: What do you want to write about?
AD: I don’t know
What should we?
Tech?
Culture?
Life?
Let’s do it bro
VC:
Sure
UX maybe 😊 inclusive UX?
AD:
That isn’t bad
Something we have strong opinions about
Or maybe contrasting opinions
Hah!
VC:
but I tend to eventually agree with yours though 😊
AD:
Other way round lol!</description>

      <description>In the past, I used to write long form blogs, with proper sentences and paragraphs :)
Restarting my site this 2020, I think it may not be effective anymore:
 Slow to write: which means I write less, not a bad thing, but I want to record more, for memory. Slow to read: I don&amp;rsquo;t think most readers have time / patience to read long form by someone like me, I am not Paul Graham, not that he write too long too.</description>
