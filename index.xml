      <description>Meta The custom theme for this website is forked from Hugo Future Imperfect SlimThe fork is here.
There are quite a few subtle differences (the images doesn&amp;rsquo;t zoom when hovered for example).
The Hugo Future Imperfect Slim theme itself is ported from HTML5 UP&amp;rsquo;s Future Imperfect.
The eventual markups, supporting styles and JavaScript for this site is statically generated using Hugo.
