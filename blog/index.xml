      <description>As a Solution Architect, I often find myself in discussions with two kinds of audiences:
The Engineer Here, I refer to those that wants to &amp;lsquo;see the matrix&amp;rsquo; to a certain depth, (i.e. how the sausage is made somewhere between assembly language to GUI).
The Executive This is from the endearing term &#39;Executive Summary&#39;.
Here, it is less about &amp;lsquo;the matrix&amp;rsquo; but how they can leverage a certain resource to maximize a certain other resource (i.</description>

      <description>If you use IoT Central, one of the most common dashboard that you may want to have is a map that shows where your IoT devices are.
Here are 3 steps steps to get such a dashboard.
 1) Add location as a capability
If your devices has the capability to send its location, this should already be configured on your device template. Otherwise, you can add the following capability:</description>

      <title>#BulletPoints for Azure SQL Database</title>

      <description>This is my #BulletPoints for Azure SQL Database.
#BulletPoints are my kind of note-taking. I think it helps while learning a new subject or preparing for a certification exam. It may not make much sense if you read it raw, but is a great aide for recall. It usually contains only unique new learnings. You can also use it to check for important points post reading the suggested documents too.</description>

      <title>To queue or not to queue</title>

      <description>Itâ€™s kind of a tacit art more than science.
It also depends on the motivations of the architect and the team.

Ideally, the queue-based load leveling pattern calls for a high throughput queue to be placed before services (such as that for data persistency) as it may be slower (memory vs disk, etc.</description>

      <title>Writing, 2020</title>

      <description>In the past, I used to write long form blogs, with proper sentences and paragraphs :)
Restarting my site this 2020, I think it may not be effective anymore:
 Slow to write: which means I write less, not a bad thing, but I want to record more, for memory. Slow to read: I don&amp;rsquo;t think most readers have time / patience to read long form by someone like me, I am not Paul Graham, not that he write too long too.</description>
