      <title>#BulletPoints for Azure SQL Database</title>

      <description>This is my #BulletPoints for Azure SQL Database.
#BulletPoints are my kind of note-taking. I think it helps while learning a new subject or preparing for a certification exam. It may not make much sense if you read it raw, but is a great aide for recall. It usually contains only unique new learnings. You can also use it to check for important points post reading the suggested documents too.</description>

Ideally, the queue-based load leveling pattern calls for a high throughput queue to be placed before services (such as that for data persistency) as it may be slower (memory vs disk, etc.</description>

      <description>In the past, I used to write long form blogs, with proper sentences and paragraphs :)
Restarting my site this 2020, I think it may not be effective anymore:
 Slow to write: which means I write less, not a bad thing, but I want to record more, for memory. Slow to read: I don&amp;rsquo;t think most readers have time / patience to read long form by someone like me, I am not Paul Graham, not that he write too long too.</description>
