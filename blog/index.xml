      <description>In the past, I used to write long form blogs, with proper sentences and paragraphs :)
Restarting my site this 2020, I realized that it may not be effective anymore:
 Slow to write: which means I write less, not a bad thing, but I want to record more, memory Slow to read: I don&amp;rsquo;t think most readers have time / patience to read long form by someone like me, I am not Paul Graham, not that he write too long too.</description>
